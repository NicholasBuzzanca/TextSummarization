I am a magazine ; ; my name is Guideposts ; ; this issue that you are reading marks my 15th anniversary .
 When I came into being , 15 years ago , I had one primary purpose : to help men and women everywhere to know God better , and through knowing Him better to become happier and more effective people .
 With our growth came expansion into new fields of service .
 Searching for the best in spiritual stories , my roving editors cover not only the country , but the whole world .
 May He bless you all .
 I am sure that Castro was happy , too , about that support .
