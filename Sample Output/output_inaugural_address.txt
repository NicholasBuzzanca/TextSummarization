My countrymen , no one can contemplate current conditions without finding much that is satisfying and still more that is encouraging .
 Our own country is leading the world in the general readjustment to the results of the great conflict .
 These results have not occurred by mere chance .
 We made freedom a birthright .
 We are at peace with all of them .
 Our program is never to oppress , but always to assist .
 No mind can comprehend them .
 No matter what others may want , these people want a drastic economy .
 Economy is idealism in its most practical form .
 That verdict stands .
 These questions involve moral issues .
 Under our institutions their rights are supreme .
 He has no voice in its making , no influence in its administration , it does not represent him .
